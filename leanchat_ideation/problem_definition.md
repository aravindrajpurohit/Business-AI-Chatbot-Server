# LeanChat Project Deliverables

This document contains all the deliverables for our Business Chatbot Proof-of-Concept (POC). The project comprises both a backend server (implemented in Flask) and a frontend UI (built with Streamlit) that answers queries based on provided product data (CSV), privacy policy, and terms & conditions documents. Additionally, our submission includes a CV and the results from the Principles You personality test.

## 1. Problem Definition Document

**Overview:**  
The business is experiencing significant customer support challenges:
- **Long Response Times:** Customers face extended waiting periods.
- **Reduced Satisfaction:** Low customer satisfaction metrics due to delayed responses.
- **High Cart Abandonment:** Extended delays contributing to increased cart abandonment.
- **Multilingual Support Gap:** Existing systems do not adequately support multilingual queries (especially Arabic).

**Data Sources & Assumptions:**  
- **Product Data:** Provided as a CSV file with semicolon-delimited fields.
- **Legal Documentation:** Privacy Policy and Terms & Conditions are supplied in PDF or TXT format and may include content in Arabic.
- **User Behavior:** Queries are expected to relate only to the product data and legal documents; out-of-scope queries should be politely declined.
- **Business Impact:**  
  - Faster responses can increase customer satisfaction.
  - Reduced human support workload.
  - Improved compliance through strict adherence to provided legal documentation.

## 2. Solution Design Document

**Proposed Architecture & Technology Stack:**

- **Frontend/UI:**  
  - **Streamlit:** For interactive web-based UI demonstration.
  
- **Backend:**  
  - **Flask:** REST API server handling file uploads, CSV URL settings, API key storage, and chat queries.
  - **LangChain:** For document ingestion, prompt chaining, and integrating with the language model.
  - **FAISS:** For indexing and querying document embeddings.
  - **HuggingFace Embeddings:** Utilizes the "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2" model for free text embeddings.
  - **Google Gemini API:** Wrapped within a custom LangChain LLM to generate responses.

- **Document Processing:**  
  - File uploads and CSV URL support.
  - **PyPDF2:** For extracting text from PDF files.
  - **Pandas:** For processing CSV files.

- **Conversation Management:**  
  - Maintains the last 5 interactions as conversation history.
  - Custom prompt template enforces responses only within the provided context.

## 3. Functional Chatbot Prototype

**Description:**  
The prototype is a working POC that demonstrates core functionality:
- **Backend Server:** Implemented in Flask (`backend.py`), exposing endpoints for file uploads, CSV URL setting, API key storage, and chat queries.
- **Frontend UI:** Built using Streamlit (`app.py`) for interactive testing.
- **Core Features:**
  - Upload product CSV data or provide a URL.
  - Upload privacy policy and terms documents (supports PDF/TXT in Arabic and English).
  - Process documents into searchable context using LangChain and FAISS.
  - Custom prompt enforces responses only based on provided context.
  - Maintains a conversation history for context-aware responses.
  - Generates answers via Google Gemini API integration.

**Usage:**  
- Run the backend server: `python backend.py`
- Run the Streamlit UI: `streamlit run app.py`
